<p>I was writing a sample application tonight for my book (which is getting very close to being done!!!) that reads a RSS/ATOM feed, loads the results into the SyndicationFeed class and binds them to a Silverlight UI. Pretty straightforward really &hellip; but still very cool. So I hit the FeedBurner Uri for my site&rsquo;s RSS feed and it loads. Hey wait a second! I am going across domains so I should get a 404 not found error, right? Hold on a second John &hellip; I am hitting FeedBurner, remember? They have a crossdomain.xml file on teir site that allows full access, so its all good.</p>
<p>For a moment I thought I was hitting my site&rsquo;s RSS feed that I host and not the feedburner Uri. If I was hitting my personal site&rsquo;s feed, I would have actually gotten the 404 error since I do not have a cross domain file on the site yet.</p>
<p>So for once I expected to hit the cross domain issue but I was pleasantly surprised not to :)</p>

<p>I love the SyndicationFeed class &hellip; anyone who has parsed feed data using an XmlReader feels the pain. LINQ to XML is a great alternative too.</p>
