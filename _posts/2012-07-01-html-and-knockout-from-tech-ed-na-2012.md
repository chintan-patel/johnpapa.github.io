<p>This is a <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/details/2012/DEV361#fbid=fBjb8v8NBNZ">KnockoutJS presentation I gave at Tech Ed NA 2012</a> conference in Orlando in June. Thank you to the almost 700 people who attended â€¦ I had a great time and really enjoyed the questions after the session. The deck, abstract and samples are in this post.</p> <p>&nbsp; <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4ff0762b0b4f3b002200f10e" data-ratio="1.7777777777777777" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script></p> <p>Abstract is below:</p> <blockquote> <p>Do you write a lot of HTML and JavaScript code to push and pull data? In this session, learn popular techniques to use data binding to bind your data to your target controls in HTML writing less code, but gaining more power. See how to consume json data, use json objects in JavaScript, use declarative binding, using KnockoutJS. Also, see how to use the MVVM pattern to write data centric JavaScript code that follows good separation patterns and creates highly maintainable code.</p></blockquote> <p>View more of my presentations on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/johnpapa">SpeakerDeck&nbsp; here</a>.</p> <p>Sample code shown in the presentation can be <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/KnockoutMVVM-TechEdNA2012.zip">found here</a>.</p> <p>If you like this you can check out in my in depth Knockout course at <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> at <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">Building HTML5 and JavaScript Apps with MVVM and Knockout</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm"><br><img title="ko ps" border="0" alt="ko ps" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/External-Templates-with-KnockoutJS_7A44/ko%20ps_3.png" width="504" height="81"></a></p>
