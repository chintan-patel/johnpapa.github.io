And if you like Knockout, be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Authors/Details?handle=john-papa">new Pluralsight course on Knockout that is coming out later this month</a>! Yeah, its about data, and has a definite lean towards patterns I love (like MVVM) … but hey, what can I say <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Getting-Started-with-Knockout.js_1238B/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png"></p> <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> <p align="justify">I intend to put out some great insight into client side topics such as Silverlight, JavaScript, XAML, Windows 8, Windows Phone, CSS,&nbsp; HTML, and much more.
