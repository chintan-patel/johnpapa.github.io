Saving data is simple, right? What app isn’t complete without some sort of saving mechanism? And while I’m at it, it’s nice to be able to track when changes occur so I can tell if a user can press the save button or even leave the current screen. Which bring me to making my buttons smart enough to know that they are already involved in a asynchronous process, so commanding would be nice. Finally, if I want to save data, it might be a good idea to validate the input on the client (and the server).

There are a lot of moving parts involved with saving changes, and I cover these in my new <a href="http://pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> course “<a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps">Single Page Apps with HTML5, ASP.NET Web API, Knockout, and jQuery</a>”.

<h5>Change Tracking</h5>
Change tracking can help make a user’s experience better and frankly, can make a developer’s life a little easier. For example, change tracking makes it easier to disable and enable buttons for saving/canceling changes. If no changes have been made, the buttons should be disabled.

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_4.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_1.png" alt="image" width="244" height="41" border="0" /></a>

If changes have been made, then these buttons would be enabled.

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_6.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_2.png" alt="image" width="244" height="41" border="0" /></a>

We can also prevent users from navigating off the page until they have either saved or canceled their changes.

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_8.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" width="244" height="54" border="0" /></a>

So how do you wire up change tracking with a SPA? The Code Camper SPA uses a custom change tracking tool that ties into <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a>. With some special tips from the KnockoutJS creators (<a href="https://twitter.com/RPNiemeyer">Ryan Niemeyer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevensanderson">Steve Sanderson</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/hfjallemark">Hans Fjällemark</a>  and I wrote a component called the DirtyFlag. You can grab the DirtyFlag as part of the <a href="http://jpapa.me/kolitegh">KoLite library on github</a> or grab <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/KoLite">KoLite on NuGet</a>.

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_10.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_4.png" alt="image" width="244" height="49" border="0" /></a>

How do we hook this up?

1. Pull KoLite into your project.

2. Wire up your model and tell it which properties you want to track changes on. (either pass an array of properties or the entire object)
<pre class="prettyprint">Person = function () {
    var self = this;
    self.id = ko.observable();
    self.firstName = ko.observable();
    self.lastName = ko.observable();
    self.dirtyFlag = new ko.DirtyFlag([
    self.firstName,
    self.lastName);
    return self;
};</pre>
3. Create a computed property on your viewmodel and check if the model is dirty or not
<pre class="prettyprint">isDirty = ko.computed(function() {
    return myPerson().dirtyFlag().isDirty();
})</pre>
Now I can check the isDirty property on the ViewModel to see if changes were made or not. I can bind this property to bindings in the View, such as buttons, too.
<h5>Commanding</h5>
When I’m about to take an asynchronous action that saves data across the wire, I want the user to know the action is still pending (via a activity indicator) and I want to prevent the button from being clicked again. The commanding technique works great for this. Built into KoLite is another component called asyncCommand which handles these situations.

So when a user clicks this button …

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_12.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_5.png" alt="image" width="244" height="82" border="0" /></a>

It should be disabled and show an activity indicator like this …

<a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_14.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/395a21820092_1066F/image_thumb_6.png" alt="image" width="244" height="71" border="0" /></a>

So how do you do this? Pull KoLite into your project and instead of writing a method that saves the data, wrap that in an ko.asyncCommand. Just like the ICommand interface in XAML, asyncCommand has 2 methods you can define: execute and canExecute.
<pre class="prettyprint">saveCmd = ko.asyncCommand({
    execute: function(complete) {
        $.when(datacontext.persons.updateData(speaker()))
            .always(complete);
    },
    canExecute: function(isExecuting) {
        return !isExecuting &amp;&amp; isDirty() &amp;&amp; isValid();
    }
})</pre>
Simply use the execute for the logic that will perform the save and define the conditions when it is appropriate for the user to be able to execute the command. Then in the HTML set the binding to use the command and optionally, the activity indicator.
<pre class="prettyprint"><button data-bind="command: saveCmd, activity: saveCmd.isExecuting"> Save</button></pre>
<h5>Validation</h5>
Validation is a huge part of a good user experience. Users expect to be told how you want the data entered. Nobody wants to enter garbage and have to wait to find out that it’s wrong … or worse, not tell them why its wrong (or even what is wrong).

HTML5 has some great validation support built in, but not everyone can take advantage of HTML5 just yet. So what do we do? This is one reason I like the <a href="https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation">Knockout.Validation</a> library: it works well without HTML5, but works better with it. This library is written by Eric Barnard and is also available on <a href="https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation">github</a> and <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Knockout.Validation">NuGet</a>.

For example, I can make a property required by extending the observable.
<pre class="prettyprint">self.firstName = ko.observable().extend({ required: true });</pre>
You can test this validation out in the <a href="http://johnpapa.aspnet45.cytanium.com/#/speakers/3">live Code Camper demo here</a>.
