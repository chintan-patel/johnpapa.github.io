<p>Today's Web landscape is fraught with numerous JavaScript libraries that are valuable. So it's inevitable that you'll ask yourself, "Which ones should I be using?" But is it important to know which one is best, or is it more important to try a few on for size? I feel like its better to research what is available and pick one the fits the best for you at the time. If you architect your solution properly, you can take it out and drop a new one in later if the mood arises <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/JavaScript-Libraries-Shoot-It-Out-at-the_10EB4/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png">.  <p>Check out this <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/06/01/gunfight-at-the-ok-corral-javascript-libraries.aspx">month’s Papa’s Perspective for more</a>.</p>
