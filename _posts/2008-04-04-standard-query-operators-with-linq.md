<p>In the March issue of MSDN Magazine's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337893.aspx">Data Points column</a> I explore a variety of the Standard Query Operators and how they work with LINQ. Here is a summary of the article: <p>In this month's column I will perform practical queries and operations with LINQ, using both LINQ to Objects and LINQ to Entities. I'll query a single collection of entities and dive deeper into a hierarchical set of entities using their navigation properties. I'll also show how you can apply many of the standard query operators to arrays and collections. I will demonstrate how LINQ's standard query operators are enhanced using lambda expressions and how they can let you parse specific information from a sequence and perform complex logic over a sequence. <p>You can check it out <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337893.aspx">here</a>. <p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337893.aspx"><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337893.aspx"><img height="349" alt="2008-03-MSDN" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/StandardQueryOperatorswithLINQ_1830/2008-03-MSDN_3.gif" width="267" border="0"></a> <p></a></p>
