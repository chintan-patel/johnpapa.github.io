<p>My <a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0903051">first article for CoDe Magazine is now online</a>.&#160; The article is a short one that explains how to use Live Search from a Silverlight application using HTTP communication. I modified an excerpt from my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a> (with the permission of Oâ€™Reilly Media of course) and made it available to CoDe Magazine. I thought that this would be a good quick example for anyone interested in how to hook into external services from Silverlight.</p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/LiveSearchfromSilverlight_11346/image_8.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/LiveSearchfromSilverlight_11346/image_thumb_2.png" width="244" height="69" /></a></p>
