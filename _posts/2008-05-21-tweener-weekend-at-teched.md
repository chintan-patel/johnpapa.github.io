<p>You probably heard that this year Tech Ed will be 2 weeks long. This leaves a weekend (June 7th and June 8th) in between where there will be a lot of people hanging around. Fortunately there are a lot of events in the area already scheduled and raring to go. One of these events is the <a href="http://www.floridatweener.com">Tweener</a> event also called the <a href="http://www.floridatweener.com">]inBetween[ event</a> run by the Florida .NET community. There will be presentations and open sessions for those who want even more. A full agenda can be seen on the <a href="http://www.floridatweener.com/">inbetween web site</a>.</p> <p> <center><img src="http://openspace.devfish.net/images/bling/blogblingMAIN_small.gif"></center> <p></p> <p>There are also <a href="http://openspace.devfish.net/">Open Space sessions</a> where anyone who wants can sign up to speak at a session (first come first serve). These sessions are open flooring and run 30 minutes. You can <a href="http://openspace.devfish.net/">sign up here for Open Space.</a></p> <p><a href="http://openspace.devfish.net/"><img height="119" src="http://openspace.devfish.net/images/banner.gif" width="569"></a></p> <p>You can <a href="http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/registrations.aspx">register</a> for the sessions on the web site or by <a href="http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/registrations.aspx">clicking this link</a>.</p> <p>Here is a sample of the agenda for those 2 days (click it for a link to the full agenda): <a href="http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/agenda.aspx"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="411" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TweenerWeekendatTechEd_A672/image_3.png" width="575" border="0"></a></p>
