<p>Looks like I’ll be heading up to Gainesville, Florida on January 15th 2009 for the <a href="http://gatormug.org/">GatorMUG .NET <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20"><img style="display: inline; margin: 5px" alt="Data Services with Silverlight 2" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/images/Data%20Services%20With%20Silverlight%202%20-%20Amazon%20cover.-%20Small.png" align="left" border="0" /></a>Users Group</a>. Gotta love them Florida Gators! This will be the first presentation I give on Silverlight after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">my book</a> is released … so I will bring some copies to give away, assuming nothing goes wrong between now and then (cross fingers).</p>  <p>I’ll be presenting a flavor of one of my SIlverlight 2 talks to the group. I have a few different talks on the topic that I have been tweaking along the way. Thanks to <a href="http://www.ineta.org/">INETA</a> for sponsoring this free event and thanks to <a href="http://gatormug.org/">GatorMUG</a> for having me!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><img title="image" height="67" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Events_13B45/image4_thumb.png" width="100" border="0" /></p>
