My presentation was on Progressive Saving with Angular, where you can stash work in progress in local storage and come back to it. It was an abbreviated version of what I present in my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">Pluralsight course Building Apps with Angular and Breeze Part 1</a> and <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz2" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, where I explore this concept in detail.

And you can <a href="http://jpapa.me/cc-ng-z" target="_blank">run the live demo of the app from this link</a>.

The conference was awesome and very well organized. All of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos?feature=watch" target="_blank">talks from the conference are online</a>. If you pick out a few, be sure to check out the talks by the AngularJS team and my friend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a>.
