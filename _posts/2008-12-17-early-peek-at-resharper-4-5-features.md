<p>From the JetBrains web site I grabbed this info below that explains the latest features that the next release of Resharper should have. I love this tool, personally. I’ve tried many refactoring tools and this is the only one that does not get in my way, is easy enough to learn, and offers me a big productivity boost. Now obviously everyone is different in how they like to code … some don’t&#160; like these tools at all, and some like others tools like Refactor Pro and Code Rush. Those are nice tools too, in fact I love their templates and their eye candy visuals. Its a great competition between these 2 tools, I love revisiting it each year and seeing who is better for me. R# has some great features for refactoring XAML in WPF and Silverlight too.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="93" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EarlyPeekatResharper4.5Features_130B1/image_3.png" width="106" align="left" border="0" />We're boosting performance in version 4.5 – ReSharper will feel like it's been turbocharged! </p>    <p>We are also unveiling a fascinating feature that deserves a special mention: Solution-Wide Analysis. In addition to the current abilities to detect errors in your entire solution, ReSharper 4.5 enables you to identify unused code, excessive access rights, overly specific types and such on. </p>    <p>Other feature highlights of ReSharper 4.5 include: </p>    <ul>     <li>Better Visual Basic support: our cross-language refactorings and editing experience enhancements will better support VB code </li>      <li>New refactorings </li>      <li>Enhanced setup for naming conventions, which will be supported by all ReSharper features </li>      <li>Multiple new productivity enhancements </li>   </ul>    <p>We expect first public builds of ReSharper 4.5 to be available by the end of the year, Q1'2009 bringing the release. And the upgrade will be free for ReSharper 4.0 customers. </p></blockquote>
