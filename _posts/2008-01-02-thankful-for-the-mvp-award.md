<p>This Holiday season I received a nice gift from the Microsoft MVP award program as I was renewed as a Microsoft C# MVP again for 2008. My program lead, Rafael, notified me yesterday that I was renewed. The MVP award is great for many reasons and I am proud to be a part of the community. </p> <p>Congratulations to all of those who were renewed and to those who were newly awarded the MVP this time around!</p><a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/profile=7d3bbcb7-e956-4730-b3e0-24bd7ead0d5d"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="80" alt="mvp" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThankfulfortheMVPAward_13504/mvp_3.jpg" width="185" border="0"></a>
