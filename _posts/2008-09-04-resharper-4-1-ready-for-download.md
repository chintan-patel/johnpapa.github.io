<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/index.html">JetBrains</a> released a new version of ReSharper today. You can download the new version, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html">ReSharper 4.1, from here</a>. They state that they improved ReSharper to work better with Visual Studio 2008 SP 1, they improved ReSharper's performance, and they added better ASP.NET support.</p>  <p>One of my favorite features is the XAML based refactoring. I do a lot of Silverlight and WPF programming so its great to have their refactorings in place with XAML in addition to the VS intellisense. I try DevExpress’s tools about once a year hoping it will challenge R# for me, but it just has not given me reason to replace R# yet. Until it gets all the features of R# with the code analysis, pre-compile, etc to the level that R# does, I am sticking with R#. But I am rooting for DevExpress to pick it up … they certainly have some nice eye candy in their app … and they’re plug in support is superior to R#. But those are ancillary to me. I need the productivity gains of R# that so far DevExpress has not reached IMO.</p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="513" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ReSharper4.1ReadyForDownload_ABEF/image_3.png" width="528" border="0" /></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/resharper-4-1-ready-for-download/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/resharper-4-1-ready-for-download/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/resharper-4-1-ready-for-download/'; var dzone_title = 'ReSharper 4.1 Ready For Download'; var dzone_blurb = 'ReSharper 4.1 Ready For Download'; var dzone_style = '1'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
