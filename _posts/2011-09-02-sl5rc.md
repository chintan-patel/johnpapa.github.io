This is a developer release, so there is no go-live license (you’ll want to wait for final release before deploying production apps). As we previously announced, the RTM is targeted to be out later this year.&nbsp; <p>I’ve blogged about the features before but here are the newest features added since Silverlight 5 beta:  <ul> <li>P/Invoke for calling native methods  <li>64-bit support for the plugin  <li>Vector printing  <li>Capabilities to support remote controls (for media)  <li>In-browser trusted apps  <li>PivotViewer now a part of Silverlight (with new features)</li></ul> <p>You can check out the great <a href="http://10rem.net/blog/2011/09/01/silverlight-5-rc-now-available">post by Pete Brown</a> for more details.</p>
