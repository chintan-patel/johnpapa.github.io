<p>This Saturday is the Tampa Code Camp 2008. The session lineup looks great so far, so be sure to stop by and spend some time learning, networking and just hanging out with a great group of people. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.tampacodecamp.com/"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="81" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TampaCodeCampThisSaturday_E36D/image_3.png" width="531" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>I will be presenting a session on Astoria and Silverlight in the morning at 9:40am. It should be a lot of fun, so please stop by and check it out. This is the last time I will be presenting this topic before the release of my book (its getting close!!!)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <blockquote>   <h4><strong>Practical ADO.NET Data Services with Silverlight </strong></h4> ADO.NET Data Services (codenamed Astoria) exposes entity models through RESTful services. It can dramatically simplify the code required to expose business objects through web services and reduce a tremendous amount of code. This session will show how to expose entity models using ADO.NET Data Services, how to consume and save data, and how to debug the communications using tools such as Fiddler. When the technology does not quite do what you need out of the box, it also allows for customizations to create custom service operations, intercept queries, and enforce permissions. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of the capabilities of ADO.NET Data Services, how to use them with Silverlight, and when and where it is ideal to use in an application architecture.</blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Register</strong>: <a title="http://www.tampacodecamp.com/" href="http://www.tampacodecamp.com/">http://www.tampacodecamp.com/</a></p>  <p><strong>Where</strong>:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; KFORCE BLDG </p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1001 East Palm Ave</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tampa, FL 33605</p>  <blockquote></blockquote>  <p><strong>Map</strong>:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a title="http://snurl.com/733l1" href="http://snurl.com/733l1">http://snurl.com/733l1</a></p>
