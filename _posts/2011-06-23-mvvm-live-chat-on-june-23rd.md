<p><a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/webcasts/index">Want to chat about MVVM with me live? You can tune into a 1 hour live webcast this Thursday morning</a> as I'll be talking about the MVVM pattern, why it exists, when it works well, and what parts you may want to use or not use. I'll also discuss common and important scenarios including messaging, testing with design timed data, and how to apply these principals to both Silverlight desktop and Windows Phone 7 applications. </p> <p>Iâ€™ll be covering these topics, but also leaving time for questions. It all starts at 8am PT on June 23rd.</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MVVM-Chat_1E91/image_4.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MVVM-Chat_1E91/image_thumb_1.png" width="437" height="224"></a></p> <p>Special thanks to Pluralsight for hosting this live webcast.</p>
