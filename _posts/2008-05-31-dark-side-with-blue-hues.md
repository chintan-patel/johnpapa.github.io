<p>I have many colleagues who have touted the merits of dark backgrounds in Visual Studio and I have tried several variations, yet I always end up back on white. It is not so much that the background needs to be white, rather it is more that I have never found a good mixture of foreground colors that work well on a dark background. Well, I spent some time this evening trying some new settings out. I was determined to find something better for me ... something that would not bother my eyes nearly as much as the bright white backgrounds. Here is what I came up with:</p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePoweroftheDarkSide_DC8/image_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="484" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePoweroftheDarkSide_DC8/image_thumb.png" width="607" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>It is a mixture of mostly blue, red, green and purple hues that seem to work pretty well for my eyes so far. It is not a true black background either. I found that if I stick to a charcoal background the colors are a bit less striking (to me of course). I like the faded look in general and imagine I will be tinkering with this for a while.</p>  <p>Here is how some XAML looks using my new scheme:</p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePoweroftheDarkSide_DC8/image_4.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="484" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePoweroftheDarkSide_DC8/image_thumb_1.png" width="602" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The red items are error highlighting from the Resharper styles. I had to tinker quite a bit to get all of the styles to work well, especially since Resharper 4 has its own styles that it injects. Will I keep this theme? Who knows. If you want to try it, I have attached the <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Dark Side with Blue Hues.rar">Dark Side with Blue Hues settings file here</a>. However be warned that you should first backup your settings file before trying any new ones. (This means &quot;try new settings at your own risk&quot;)</p>  <p>I'll be turning it back to normal if I take any screen shots for my chapters or articles, though. No need to force my craziness on the editors :)</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:B3E14793-948F-49af-A347-D19C374A7C4F:60dff076-9c7e-4a27-8613-b5ec5be260ce" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
