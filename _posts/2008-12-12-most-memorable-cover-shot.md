<p>Now that my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Silverlight 2 book</a> is going to be in stores very soon I’ve taken a look back at some of the books I wrote through the years. Here is a cover shot from an ADO book I coauthored eons ago. And no, the new book has a very normal cover … no more pyramids!</p>  <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away … I wrote a book with 4 of my friends. The book may not be remembered, but the cover certainly has been. 10 years later I still have people come up to me and say “hey, that was you on that crazy cover!”. Ah, geeky humor :)</p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MostMemorableCoverShot_48/image_2.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="344" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MostMemorableCoverShot_48/image_thumb.png" width="271" border="0" /></a></p>
