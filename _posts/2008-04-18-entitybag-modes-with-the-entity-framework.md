<p>I've been using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/archive/2008/01/20/entitybag-part-ii-modes-and-constructor.aspx">EntityBag concept that Danny Simmons has been posting</a> for a while now. One of the neat aspects of the EntityBag is its automatic mode settings. As I was explaining this to someone this week (as a precursor to my 2 Entity Framework DevConnections talks next week in Orlando), it occurred to me to create a small table explaining the highlights of the modes. So here is the 20,000 foot view of the modes of an EntityBag. You can find <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/archive/2008/01/20/entitybag-part-ii-modes-and-constructor.aspx">more about the EntityBag and its modes on Danny's blog</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EntityBagModes_F581/image_2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="264" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EntityBagModes_F581/image_thumb.png" width="557" border="0"></a></p>
