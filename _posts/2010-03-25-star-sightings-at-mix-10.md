<p>Hey its Vegas baby! Brad was stylin. Tim and I were a poor manâ€™s Vin Diesel and Tom Cruise. The jacket and shades actually suited Karen. Dan looked like he worked in Vegas. Ward was, well, Ward.</p>  <p>Was it the town, the conference, or are we all just wacky developer/designer types? Ward Bell brought along his jacket, shirt and shades and of course we all just had to get into the act. (If you think this is crazy, wait til you see what Ward did to top it in our upcoming Silverlight TV video!)</p>  <p>Yet another reason MIX is still my favorite conference.</p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/StarSightingsatMIX10_133BF/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/StarSightingsatMIX10_133BF/image_thumb.png" width="511" height="382" /></a></p>
