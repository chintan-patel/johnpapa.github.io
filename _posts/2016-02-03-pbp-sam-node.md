Recently I had a great opportunity to sit down with the amazing Sam Artioli to build a flexible Node app from scratch. I love coding on the fly, and I love pair programming with awesome developers. That's why I enjoy filming these Play by Play videos. [You can watch Sam in action here.](http://jpapa.me/pbpsamnode)

Here is the description of the video with me and Sam ...

>[In this video](http://jpapa.me/pbpsamnode), NodeJS expert Sam Artioli builds a web app from scratch. You'll learn how to set up a Node app, build a web API with Express, integrate with MongoDB, and cache HTTP results with Redis. You'll also learn some expert techniques, such as offloading and proxying requests to multiple Node servers, organizing API routes, and avoiding blocking process and taking advantage of Node's event loop. [Exercise files for the course are located here](https://github.com/samartioli/node-web-api).
