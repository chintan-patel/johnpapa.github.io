<p>I took a break from blogging (and most everything else) for a few weeks to spend some time with my family and enjoy our new son. Yep, after 3 girls we had a boy! Everyone is healthy and we are now a happy and larger family.</p>  <p>I’ve been digging my way out of a pile of “things to do” and realized that I had missed my article in the April 2009 MSDN Magazine issue. In that issue <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd569758.aspx" target="_blank">I wrote an article titled “Using Silverlight 2 with ADO.NET Data Services” in my Data Points column</a>, the article addresses some common issues that arise when dealing with these technologies such as cross domain communications, passing sensitive data, deferred loading, and saving data (too many examples show retrieval only).<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd569758.aspx" target="_blank">You can give it a read over here</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd569758.aspx"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2009-04-MSDN" border="0" alt="2009-04-MSDN" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TipsSilverlightandADO.NETDataServices_58F/2009-04-MSDN_3.gif" width="268" height="347" /></a></p>
