I’ve been using Blend on a daily basis as a developer since version 2 on both WPF and Silverlight projects and it is absolutely indispensable for much of my work. </p>  <p>I’ve used Blend to help create many applications prior coming to Microsoft. More recently, the <a href="http://jpapa.me/9QaesR">ebay Simple Lister</a> application relied heavily on Blend to create its views, transitions, and interactive nature and the views for the <a href="http://bit.ly/cXQ8yq">Sticky plugin I created for Seesmic Desktop 2</a> only took a day due to Blend.</p>  <p>SketchFlow is one of my favorite parts of Blend. It has helped me create interactive mockups, communicate with customers, and gather feedback at an entirely new level. SketchFlow has been more than just a mockup tool, it has helped speed up the process of creating applications like the <a href="http://jpapa.me/9QaesR">ebay Simple Lister</a> by making the iterative collaboration between the developer and the customer richer. </p>  <p>Here are just some of the new features of Blend 4:</p>  <ul>   <li>SketchFlow includes <a href="http://jpapa.me/ayEGtw">new mockup controls</a> and “<a href="http://jpapa.me/bK6qoe">Sketchables</a>” </li>    <li>VS2010 compatibility </li>    <li>Windows Phone support </li>    <li>Deeper Adobe Photoshop import (layer effects) </li>    <li>New behaviors &amp; conditional behaviors </li>    <li>Enhanced sample data support </li>    <li>Listbox path layout for designing with data </li>    <li>Pixel Shader effects (including animations) </li>    <li>Easier styling and customization </li>    <li>Model View View-Model support </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Expression Encoder 4</strong></p>  <p>I have become a great fan of Encoder. it makes adding visual overlays and creating multiple formats of Silverlight TV shows simple for me.</p>  <p>Here are just some of the new features of Encoder 4:</p>  <ul>   <li>Live Smooth Streaming (VC-1 and H.264) </li>    <li>New H.264 encoder from MainConcept </li>    <li>DRM (PlayReady) for live content </li>    <li>Enhanced Screen Capture </li> </ul>
