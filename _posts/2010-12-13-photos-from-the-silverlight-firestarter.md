So THANK YOU! We had a photographer floating around the live event and he was able to capture several shots of folks who attended. I uploaded a bunch of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnpapa/sets/72157625462476083/">Firestarter photos to Flickr tonight and shared them</a>, so please have a look through and add comments if you like. There are more, but these were a good sampling from the event. </p>  <p>If you missed the event, or in case you want to watch some of it again, all <a href="/silverlight/slfs10sessions/">of the videos are online and on demand</a> (including their slide decks and some demos). </p>  <p>We also posted a <a href="/silverlight/silverlight-tv-54-introducing-11-brand-new-labs/">brand new Silverlight training kit which includes 11 labs of varying levels</a>, written by Silverlight MVPs Corey Schuman and Dan Wahlin. (Thanks fellas!)</p>
