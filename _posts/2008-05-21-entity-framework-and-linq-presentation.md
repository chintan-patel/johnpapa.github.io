<p>I had a great time at the <a href="http://ineta.org">INETA</a> sponsored combined <a href="http://sarasotasql.net/">Sarasota SQL Server</a> and <a href="http://www.sarasotadev.net/">Sarasota .NET User groups'</a> meeting <a href="/all/entity-framework-amp-linq-tonight-in-sarasota/">last Wednesday evening</a>. I presented the Entity Framework and LINQ using the latest bits, which came out 2 days prior to the presentation. It made for some interesting moments as I barely had enough time to convert all of my demos over to the latest bits. Yeah, I know, I should have just went with the old bits, but the smart me was sleeping and the bold me took the wheel :)</p> <p>I've attached my <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/EF Sarasota 5-2008 Slides.rar">slide deck</a> and some <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/EF Sarasota 5-2008 Demos.rar">demo code</a> that I used for the presentation. The code has been converted to work with the Visual Studio and .NET 3.5 SP 1 beta bits. Everything is "as is" as some of the demo code I wrote on the fly at the presentation.</p> <p>There were about 40 people there for the presentation and it was a very lively and interactive group. A lot of good questions were posed and thought he flow was pretty fast it seemed to be well received. </p> <p><a href="http://www.ineta.org/"><img alt="INETA" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/images/INETA.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
