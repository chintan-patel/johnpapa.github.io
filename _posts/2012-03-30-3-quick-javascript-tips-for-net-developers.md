<p>Yesterday at the <a href="http://devconnections.com/home.aspx">DevConnections</a> event I had to make an emergency speaking appearance for a speaker who became suddenly ill. Luckily that talk was a topic I know well (JavaScript intro for .NET developers), I was available, and I didn’t freak out <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/3-Quick-JavaScript-Tips_A886/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png">&nbsp;</p> <p>I grabbed the speaker’s deck and used it as a guideline, but I spent the majority of the time in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle.net</a> writing examples. The audience was really interactive and grasped the basics pretty quickly. The topics that we spent the most amount of time discussing as a group where regarding namespaces, functions and objects. So I thought I might include 3 of the examples here on my blog.</p> <h4>Namespacing</h4> <p>Namespacing is an important (and easy) way to make sure your objects do not collide with other javascript libraries. There are many ways to handle namespacing, but the way I like to start with is dead simple. This example shows that all variables hang off the ‘my’ namespace. I like using ‘my’ because its short and sweet.</p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/t6TBv/embedded/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <h4>Creating an Object Literal</h4> <p>Objects can be created in a variety of ways. But the most common you will see in demos is the object literal. The reason? Its short and sweet. Objects can be created simply by setting a variable equal to an open and close curly brace pair, as shown below. Then add properties as needed. I often use this syntax for simple objects (not a lot of logic, mostly properties and a few methods). </p> <p>The ‘this’ keyword does work with the object literal, though once you get into nesting functions it can get unwieldy unless you manage ‘this’. That’s often when I use one of a few techniques such as setting ‘this’ (at a place where you know what ‘this’ represents for certain) to a variable called self. But I’ll hit that topic in a later post.</p> <p>I most often use object literals for passing arguments to functions </p> <p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/XNPH9/embedded/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <h4>Creating an Object from a Function</h4> <p>You can also create objects through functions. While I prefer using a pattern such as the Revealing Module pattern for this, the simplest way to create an object from a function is shown below. Note that use of ‘self’ in here to represent ‘this’. It may not be needed in all cases but it’s a good habit to get into that has saved me many times. A friend of mine actually uses the word ’me’ instead of self … says its twice as fast <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/3-Quick-JavaScript-Tips_A886/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png"></p> <p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/uZMfH/embedded/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
