<p>Today I saw the first copies of my book in print, hot off the presses. So where can you get it? </p>  <ul>   <li>You can <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">purchase the ebook today from O’Reilly’s site</a> </li>    <li>You can buy the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">print version of the book also from O’Reilly’s site</a> </li>    <li>You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">purchase it from Amazon</a>, who will be receiving my book in the next few days (obviously O’Reilly gets it first) </li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/Book%20is%20in%20print_2.jpg"><img title="Book is in print" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 10px 5px 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="184" alt="Book is in print" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/Book%20is%20in%20print_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a>Very soon, I will be creating an online area for the book at <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> where you can find the code samples in both C# and VB, updates to the book, additional materials as I put them out, and various other book related topics. <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> will be the goto place for any updates for the book. This should be up before the end of the year. If code samples need to be updated at some point, I will make adjustments online. Of course, code samples will be available from <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a>&#160; and from O’Reilly’s site, too.</p>  <p>For now, you can find the code samples for the book in my&#160; l<img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/image_8.png" width="260" align="right" border="0" />inks section. Just go to <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> and scroll down on the right hand site and look for “Links”.
