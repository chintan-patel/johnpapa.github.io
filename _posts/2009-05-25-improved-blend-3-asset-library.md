<p>Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/unnir/archive/2009/05/22/the-blend-3-asset-library.aspx">this post by Unni</a> (Program Manager with the Blend team). It’s a visual thing, yes, but it makes it easier to find the items in Blend. I’ll come clean right now … several times I have not been able to find an asset I was looking for because I forgot to check the right box or click the right option in the Asset Library in Blend. This rearranged window is so much more intuitive to me. Kudos to the Blend team!</p>  <p><strong>Blend 3</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ImprovedBlend3AssetLibrary_A72B/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ImprovedBlend3AssetLibrary_A72B/image_thumb.png" width="561" height="325" /></a></p>
