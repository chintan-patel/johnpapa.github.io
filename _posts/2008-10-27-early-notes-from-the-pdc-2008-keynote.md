<p>Here are some random and early notes from the first half of the PDC&rsquo;s keynote this morning, mostly about Azure.</p>
<p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="317" alt="image" width="526" border="0" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NotesfromthePDCKeyNote_B2E0/image_3.png" /></p>
<ul>

<li>Cloud service operating system</li>

<li>Supports SOAP, REST, and POX</li>
<li>App and the OS are managed separately</li>
<li>All about scalability and availability</li>
<li>High availability
<ul>
<li>Highly redundant. No double failure of hardware can bring it down. Caching, load balancing also built in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leverages Microsoft tools. Works with managed and native code</li>
<li>New Cloud Templates for Azure in Visual Studio</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="236" alt="image" width="536" border="0" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NotesfromthePDCKeyNote_B2E0/image_14.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of focus on migrating the enterprise application strategy to the cloud concept</li>
<li>Partners include bluehoo and Red Prairie</li>
<li>Oslo is the &ldquo;new modeling platform&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Uses a new language called &ldquo;m&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do I make if all of this? There were a lot of keywords, buzzwords, power words, etc thrown out. Don;t get me wrong, it all sounds great. But it was very heavy on buzz and light on details. That&rsquo;s not totally fair as I expect the details will come out this week, but the problem with all of this is that the audience generally are types who want to see things in action. The good news is that the direction sounds great, right on target. The whole cloud services paradigm is where its at.</p>
