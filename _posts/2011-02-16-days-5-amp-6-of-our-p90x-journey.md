<p>&ldquo;Dad, you only have 84 days left!&rdquo; says my oldest daughter today on the way to school. That big mountain ahead of me, I still feel good about our first 6 days on P90X. Truth be told, I&rsquo;ll still be exercising after this &hellip; I was exercising about 8 hours a week before, just not to this extent of intensity and well roundedness. But I am not going to think about day 90 yet &hellip; heck, I&rsquo;m not thinking more than a day or 2 ahead right now.</p>
<p>My wife Colleen and I are enjoying the P90X videos. The exercises change every minute or so and Tony Horton is very entertaining. Colleen is doing the lean program and I am doing the classic, so days 3-7 are the same for us. I&rsquo;m really proud of how she is doing with this program and the diet. It really helps to have each other for support.</p>
<p>Day 5 was backs and legs. The weight workout for my back was good, but certainly not as strenuous as the gajillions of pushups on Day 1 (Back and Chest). The legs were a good workout, with the only exercise that really killed me being the wall squats. I could really feel the burn there. Overall, great workout for Day 5 but I was not wiped out by it the way I was for the others. Perhaps the Yoga from the day before had be all limber <img src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Days-5--6-of-our-P90X-Journey_1C4/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /></p>
<p>We did the Kenpo X video on day 6 as today &hellip; which is a ton of kicks, punches and blocks in the martial arts style. It&rsquo;s a great workout that I felt in both cardio and working the muscles. The workout was not difficult though many of the moves take a lot of coordination that at times can be daunting for beginners like us.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the stretching day and then we work into week 2 of the first 30 days. I&rsquo;m feeling great and I am noticing some small improvements in some areas. Colleen is feeling much better too. More energy for both us and we&rsquo;re enjoying the workouts. We both sighed at the thought of a stretching day tomorrow as we both want to keep at it. But the rest/stretching is part of the program so the body can recover.</p>
<p>One thing we&rsquo;re both considering is getting a heart rate monitor. The gym machines are a joke as I can have a heart rate of 90 or even 168 when I sprint &hellip; um, if I could sprint with a HR of 90 &hellip; well, that;s just wrong. The HR monitors with chest straps seem to still be the most accurate, so I&rsquo;ll likely pick one up that does basic HR. It is handy to make sure we are in the zone &hellip; helps to tell if we need to push it harder or even when we need to rest.</p>
