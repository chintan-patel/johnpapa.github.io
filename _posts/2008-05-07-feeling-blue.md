<p>Today I decided to try out a new theme for my site. <a href="http://richmercer.com/graffiti-themes/#deepblue">Rich Mercer has a handful of nice themes</a> posted in his site including this one, which is a variation of the Point Space Blue theme. I'm going to try it out and see where it takes me. Its a pretty clean theme though there are a few items I need to touch up for certain. Hey if anything, my daughter likes this one the best so far.</p> <p>I have been thrilled with the flexibility and the low maintenance of <a href="http://graffiticms.com">Graffiti CMS</a>. I spend so much less time fixing problems than I used to with other products that I will leave unnamed.</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/FeelingBlue_ACFA/image_4.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="484" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/FeelingBlue_ACFA/image_thumb_1.png" width="487" border="0"></a></p>
