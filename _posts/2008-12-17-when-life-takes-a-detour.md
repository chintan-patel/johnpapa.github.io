<p>Today was supposed to be the geekSpeek webcast for my ADO.NET Data Services and Silverlight topic …. however … life took a detour. <img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="193" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WhenLifeTakesaDetour_F0E4/image_6.png" width="200" align="left" border="0" /> </p>  <p>This morning my family had a little scare and I had to rush to the hospital when my unborn son decided to shake things up a bit. Both mom and the baby are doing fine after hours&#160; and yes we convinced him to stay inside for what we hope is another 11 weeks when she is due. We were very touched by all of he emails, text messages and tweets we received from so many people today. Thank you all very much for the thoughts, kind words and prayers.</p>  <p>Back off the detour … I apologize for the postponement of the geekSpeek webcast and I appreciate your patience as we rescheduled it to January 8th, at 3pm EST (12 PT). The topic will be using ADO.NET Data Services from Silverlight, one of my favorite topics :) Come for the great topic, conversation and demos! This is a great chance to hear about some of the topics from my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a>.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <h3><a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032397110&amp;EventCategory=4&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US">MSDN Webcast: geekSpeak: Silverlight and ADO.NET Data Services with John Papa (Level 200)</a> </h3>  <h4>Event ID: 1032397110</h4>  <p><strong>Start Date:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032397110&amp;EventCategory=4&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US">Thursday, January 8, 2009 12:00 PM Pacific Time (US &amp; Canada)</a></p>  <p><b>Event Overview</b></p>  <p>In this geekSpeak, Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) John Papa explores how to consume ADO.NET Data Services from a Microsoft Silverlight 2 application.
