<p>I recently signed on with <a href="http://www.InsideRIA.com">www.InsideRIA.com</a> to write a guest blog. <a href="http://www.insideria.com/2008/10/silverlight-2---what-a-ride.html">In my first post I wrote about my excitement at how the Silverlight 2 community has become so interested in it</a>. While its a small community relative to the entire .NET community I have seen a great impact in a very short time (considering its only been viable since June with the Go Live license for SL2 Beta 2).&#160; The funny thing about this article I posted is that it had an unintended consequence as it seemed to make a lot of people upset. <a href="http://www.insideria.com/2008/10/silverlight-2---what-a-ride.html">Check it out</a>. I stand by my statements as I really do think SIlverlight 2 has already had an impact and it will continue to grow. The discussion is good stuff though.</p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="115" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/UpinArmsOverSilverlight2_AB59/image_3.png" width="260" border="0" /></p>
