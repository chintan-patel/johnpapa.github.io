<p><a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL">DevConnections</a> in Orlando is just around the corner and I'll be there presenting 4 sessions on mobile development, the Entity Framework and SQL Server. So much has changed with these technologies in the past few months so I have all new code samples for new techniques using the latest bits, especially with the Entity Framework. if you are going to be at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL">DevConnections</a> in April in Orlando, please stop by one of my sessions and say hi.</p> <p>Here are the 4 session abstracts:</p> <p><b>VMD302: Data Access Techniques and LINQ in Mobile Applications</b><br><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br>Data access layers, domain entities, and databases are all integral components of dealing with data in an enterprise application. Mobile applications also rely heavily on these types of data vehicles and stores. This session will delve into different ways of handling data in mobile applications using ADO.NET objects and domain entities. I will demonstrate different data binding techniques in mobile applications using both domain entities and DataSets as well as techniques using LINQ to interact with data on a mobile device. <blockquote> <p><b></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>VDA203: Getting Started with the Entity Framework</b><br><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br>The Entity Framework can be used to architect applications against a conceptual model that is mapped to the logic model. The Entity Framework has many components including EntityClient, Entity SQL, Object Services, the Entity Data Model, and LINQ to Entities. This session will discuss the architecture of the Entity Framework and explain the roles of each of its different components. It will also demonstrate how to write queries using the different options as well as how to evaluate which options within Object Services to use or if to use the EntityClient provider directly. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>VDA202: Customizing Entity Data Models in the Entity Framework</b><br><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br>Designing the Entity Data Model with the Entity Framework is a critical aspect in developing an architecture. Once the model has been created it is beneficial to know how to customize the model to adapt to the business problems. This session will explore the different XML files that map the objects to the database schema and show how to modify them when needed. I will explain how you can design an object model with the Entity Framework using both the Entity Data Model Wizard as well as&nbsp; by manually editing the XML files. I will demonstrate how to implement inheritance, how to merge multiple entities within&nbsp; a conceptual model, how to take advantage of features such as conditions in the mapping layer, how to implement complex types, and how to hook into stored procedures. This session will demonstrate how to interact with the conceptual model using EntityClient, Entity SQL, and LINQ to Entities to perform queries and make updates to a database.  <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL"><img alt="DevConnections" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/images/fall07connexdata.png" border="0"></a></p>
