<p>I wrote my Data Points article for the September 2008 issue of MSDN Magazine using Silverlight 2 Beta 2. Since then the RC0 bits have been released, which broke my code for the article. I&rsquo;ve had several requests for the updated code &hellip; and now that my book is winding down I have had some time to go back and fix up the code for this article. Feel free to download the latest bits for the Sep 2008 article titled <a href="/all/service-driven-apps-with-wcf-and-silverlight-2/">Service Driven Apps with WCF and Silverlight 2</a> <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/MSDN Mag - 2008-09.rar">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
