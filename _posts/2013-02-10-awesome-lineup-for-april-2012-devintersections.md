Technology has been changing at a rapid pace over the past few years and so are conferences. It’s a great time to head to one of the newer conferences like <a href="http://devintersection.com?papa" target="_blank">ASP.NET and HTML5 DevIntersection  from April 8 - 11 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, NV</a>. I’ll be there with a whole new round of sessions myself including talks on JavaScript, TypeScript and a full day workshop on building Single Page Applications.

Of course, there’s much much more too including many great speakers like:

<blockquote>Single Page Apps (SPAs) focus on delivering better user experiences with significant client-side interactions using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Now you can get started with SPA using the ASP.NET SPA Template. This workshop explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MVVM, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, rich data features, and responsive design for mobility. Along the way I'll also touch on popular libraries such as Knockout, Durandal, and Breeze. This workshop covers:</blockquote>
