<p>Last week in Germany at DevConnections, I presented a session on 10 cool features in Silverlight 5. This presentation was a combination of demos that both I and Pete Brown had put together over the past few weeks. You can <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/DevConGermany2011.SL5Slides.zip">download the slide deck</a> and the <a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/DevConGermany2011.SL5Demos.zip">sample code right here</a>. </p> <p>The 10 topics I chose to demonstrate are:</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/10-Silverlight-5-Demos_142FD/image_4.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/10-Silverlight-5-Demos_142FD/image_thumb_1.png" width="504" height="259"></a></p> <p>I also presented a talk on MVVM, which uses the same BookShelf app demo I used at the Silverlight Firestarter. You can <a href="http://cid-db8de07d70b6e4b7.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public?sa=297082339">download the deck and demo for that from this link</a>.</p> <p>Note: Iâ€™m working on cleaning up my demos from my joint talk with Dan Wahlin on <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a>, which covered MVVM concepts. </p>
