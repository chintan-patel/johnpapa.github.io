<p>I’ve had my Kindle 2 for a week and my early impressions are favorable, though I do have some dislikes already too. Overall its a great machine that handles books very well, is easy on the eyes and very easy to hold onto (form factor is sweet). I’ll be posting a review on the Kindle 2 in the near future … I’ve been a bit sidetracked with the new birth of my son :)</p>  <p>In the Twitterverse today I saw <a href="http://twitter.com/scottw">Scott Watermasysk</a> point out a new app for the iPhone titled <a href="http://appshopper.com/books/kindle-for-iphone">“Kindle for iPhone”.</a> It is a free application and is just as it appears … it allows you to read your kindle books on the iPhone. I tried it out and it is just as advertised. </p>  <p><a href="http://appshopper.com/books/kindle-for-iphone">Here are the details from the web site:</a></p>  <blockquote>   <h4>Kindle for iPhone</h4>    <p>Kindle for iPhone allows Apple iPhone and iPod touch owners to read Kindle books using a simple, easy-to-use interface. You can shop for hundreds of thousands of books at www.amazon.com/kindlestore, and wirelessly transfer the books to your iPhone or iPod touch. Enjoy Amazon’s low prices on Kindle books, including New York Times Best Sellers and most new releases for $9.99, unless marked otherwise.      <br />With Kindle for iPhone, you can:      <br /></p>    <ul>     <li>Buy a Kindle book from your Mac, PC, or iPhone using a Web browser and wirelessly transfer the books to your iPhone</li>      <li>Read first chapters of any book for free before you buy </li>      <li>Download the Kindle books you already own for free — they are automatically backed up on Amazon.com </li>      <li>Adjust the text size, add bookmarks, and view the annotations you created on your Kindle device </li>   </ul>    <p>     <br />Kindle for iPhone also includes Whispersync, which allows you to seamlessly switch back and forth between your Kindle device and Kindle for iPhone while keeping your bookmarks and reading location synchronized between devices. Now you can easily pick up reading right where you left off on your Kindle or iPhone.      <br />Books you purchase can also be read on Kindle and Kindle 2, Amazon’s portable readers that wirelessly download books, newspapers, magazines, and blogs to a crisp, high-resolution 6-inch electronic-paper display that looks and reads like real paper. </p> </blockquote>  <h5><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/KindlefortheiPhone_7E99/image_3.png" width="340" height="500" /></h5>
