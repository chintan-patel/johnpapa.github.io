Maybe it’s community feel about it because every time I go to MIX I feel like I am catching up with good friends (because I am). MIX09 was my first MIX in person (I really wanted to be at the previous ones) and I was fortunate enough to present at MIX09 on debugging Silverlight apps. Last year (my first MIX working for Microsoft) I hosted the Silverlight bootcamp and presented with Mike Taulty. But the people I met at the past 2 MIX events are what I remember the most. </p>  <p>I’ll be there again this year! Will you? Not sure if you can make it? Well, this year we are bringing back the “open call” for presenters and topics. I grabbed the details form the web site and posted them below. Be sure to check this out. We had a bunch of great sessions come from this last year with folks like Laurent Bugnion, Shawn Wildermuth, Rob Eisenberg, and many more. Will yours get picked this year? You’ve got nothing to lose so put your best foot forward and submit a killer topic … then promote it!</p>  <p><strong><em>… from the MIX web site …</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Be a “Best of Web” Presenter at MIX11</strong></p>  <p><font size="3">Are you an expert on web development, design or monetization?
