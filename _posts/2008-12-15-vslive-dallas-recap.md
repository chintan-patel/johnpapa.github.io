<p>Last week I presented several sessions at <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> Dallas along with some great other speakers. I attached the latest session code samples to this blog post since some of the code was written on the fly. It was a cold couple of days in Dallas, a brisk change from southwest Florida! But it really was a blast. We had a great group of speakers and attendees in a smaller atmosphere than some in the past. The result was even more discussions, great conversations and camaraderie. Some of the best discussions came from the <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> speaker panel event where several speakers including Richard, Rocky, Josh, <a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse</a>, Rich and I all had to answer some interesting and some tough questions about .NET state today and its future. It was all great stuff and I look forward to the next one.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/VSLive Dallas 2008 - EF Code Samples.rar">Entity Framework demos</a></li>    <li><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/VSLive Dallas 2008 - MVP.rar">MVP Patterns demo</a></li>    <li><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/VSLive Dallas 2008 - System.Transactions.rar">System.Transactions demos</a></li> </ul>
