<a href="http://twitter.com/danwahlin" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a> and I have just published a new course at <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight </a>titled <a href="http://jpapa.me/typescript101" target="_blank">TypeScript Fundamentals</a> . This course walks you through the key concepts and features that you need to know to get started with <a href="http://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, and use it to build large (and small) scale JavaScript applications.

<h2>Course Description</h2>
TypeScript is a new open source language that provides support for building enterprise scale JavaScript applications. Although several patterns exist that can be used to structure JavaScript, TypeScript provides container functionality that object-oriented developers are familiar with such as classes and modules. It also supports strongly-typed code to ensure inappropriate values aren't assigned to variables in an application. This course will walk you through the key concepts and features that you need to know to get started with TypeScript, and use it to build enterprise scale JavaScript applications. You’ll learn the role that TypeScript plays as well as key features that will help jump-start the learning process.
<h5>1: Getting Started with TypeScript</h5>
TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that offers several benefits to both client-side and server-side developers. In this module you'll learn about the different features that TypeScript offers and see how it can be used with tools such as Visual Studio, Sublime Text and others to structure code and even catch issues as you're writing code.
<h5>2: Typings, Variables, and Functions</h5>
This module covers the core features of TypeScript including the TypeScript grammar, optional type annotations, built in primitive types, ambient declarations, and special types. Also covered are arrow functions, simple interfaces, functions, objects and more.
<h5>3: Classes and Interfaces</h5>
In this module you'll learn how classes can be defined and extended using TypeScript and the resulting JavaScript that's generated. You'll also learn about interfaces and the role they can play in adding consistency across classes.
<h5>4: Modules</h5>
This module explains what TypeScript's modules are, how to identify them, when to use them, and various ways to use them with and without patterns such as AMD.
<h2>More Details?</h2>
While writing the course I wrote a series of posts the map loosely to the modules:
<ul>
	<li>Part 1 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost1/" target="_blank">Getting Started with TypeScript</a></li>
	<li>Part 2 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost2/" target="_blank">TypeScript Grammar</a></li>
	<li>Part 3 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost3/" target="_blank">TypeScript Classes and Interfaces</a></li>
	<li>Part 4 – Modules - (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Next Course Will be ...</h2>
While the paint is still drying on the TypeScript course I'm mapping out the flow for my next course. I decided to create a course that goes step by step through building a rich web app. This fits in nicely as a beginner level course for building a SPA, slotting right before my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">Code Camper SPA course at Pluralsight</a>. The existing SPA course covers a lot of ground for building a full featured Rich Web App (RWA) or SPA, and it demonstrates exactly how robust you can make yours web apps. Now it is time to go back and show from scratch how you can build a SPA from the ground up. It should be an exciting prelude that leads right into the existing SPA course as part of a learning path for the topic. I have several other ideas for courses after this next one, but I'm going to take it 1 at a time.
