<p>Recently <a href="http://feeds.sparklingclient.com/~r/SparklingClient/~3/413973798/">Erik Mork interviewed me for his Sparkling Client podcast</a> and we chatted about accessing data services with Silverlight 2. We talked a lot about interacting with Silverlight 2 with REST and SOAP, isolated storage, creating WCF services for Silverlight 2, WCF binding types, ADO.NET Data Services, and more. Basically all topics from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">my book</a> (which is very close to getting out).</p>

We both love the topic, so we had to force ourselves to stop somewhere. There are a lot of people who are passionate about Silverlight 2 and the related technologies including both Erik and I, so this was a lot of fun. We touched on several topics and we saved others for future podcasts.</p>
<p>You can check out the interview (all of about 14 minutes) on the <a href="http://feeds.sparklingclient.com/~r/SparklingClient/~3/413973798/">Sparkling Podcast web site</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never gotten used to how my voice sounds on podcasts and webcasts :). Maybe someday.</p>
