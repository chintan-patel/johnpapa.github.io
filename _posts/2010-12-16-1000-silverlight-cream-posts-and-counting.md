<p><a href="http://jpapa.me/sltv55">This week on Silverlight TV, John welcomes Dave Campbell</a>. Dave, a Silverlight MVP and creator of <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/WynApseTechnicalMusings/Default.aspx">Silverlight Cream</a>, recently published his 1000th Silverlight Cream post, calling out the best and most interesting Silverlight content on the web. Dave was in town for the Silverlight Firestarter where we surprised him with a poster signed by a lot of folks on the Silverlight team. Dave and John discuss how Silverlight Cream got started and has evolved as Dave calls out several great people from the community who have helped him along the way. </p>  <p><a href="http://jpapa.me/sltv55"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/374d9ce89921_CE1B/image_3.png" width="350" height="181" /></a></p>  <p><em>NOTE: Silverlight TV will be taking a break over the holidays and pick back up on Jan 6th.</em></p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnpapa/sets/72157625462476083/">More photos from the Silverlight Firestarter</a></p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SilverlightTV">@SilverlightTV</a> or on the web at <a href="http://silverlight.tv/">http://silverlight.tv</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnpapa/sets/72157625462476083/"><img alt="" src="http://files.channel9.msdn.com/thumbnail/f46daba2-6cbf-4e80-855d-a8e4b643aa8e.jpg" width="352" height="519" /></a></p>
