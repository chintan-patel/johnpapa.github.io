<p></p>  <p>This New Years Day I received a nice gift from the Microsoft MVP award program as I was renewed as a Microsoft C# MVP again for 2009. On Jan 1 Jake, my awesome program lead, notified me that I was renewed once again. I really do enjoy being part of the MVP community. This is my 4th year in the program and the best part is that I have met a lot of great people through this program throughout our profession.</p>  <p>Congratulations to all of those who were renewed and to those who were newly awarded the MVP this time around!</p> <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=7D3BBCB7-E956-4730-B3E0-24BD7EAD0D5D"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="80" alt="mvp" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThankfulfortheMVPAward_13504/mvp_3.jpg" width="185" border="0" /></a>
