<p>My father's family migrated to America from Italy in the early 1900's. Specifically, they came from the town of Castiglione in Sicilia. I have seen some incredible photos of the volcano that happens to be the next door neighbor to Castiglione , but with today's mapping tools it is pretty compelling to see how close Mt Aetna truly is. Check out this photo ... notice the dark green spot to the southwest o the green arrow? That is Mt Aetna. The green arrow is Castiglione.</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheresaVolcanoinMyYard_13756/image_2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="356" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheresaVolcanoinMyYard_13756/image_thumb.png" width="519" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Here is a closer view of the town and Mt Aetna. Now that is a house with a view!</p> <p><a href="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheresaVolcanoinMyYard_13756/image_4.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="517" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheresaVolcanoinMyYard_13756/image_thumb_1.png" width="519" border="0"></a></p>
