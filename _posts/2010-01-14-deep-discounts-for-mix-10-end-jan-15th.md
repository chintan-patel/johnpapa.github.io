<p>My favorite conference of the year is approaching fast! MIX10 is shaping up to be a fantastic conference yet again. If you have attended MIX in prior years you know how the people and conversations found at MIX are top notch, rewarding and just a lot of fun. One of most memorable times at MIX09 is just the time I hung out in the common room where it seems everyone gathers before, during and after sessions. The keynote, sessions and speakers are all top notch and the after parties are not to be missed!</p>  <p><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DeepDiscountsforMIX10EndJan15th_7A1B/image_6.png" width="644" height="113" /></a> </p>  <p><strong>How can I get there?</strong></p>  <p>Last year there was a very popular discount promotion where you can get half price off and a deep discount on the hotel.
