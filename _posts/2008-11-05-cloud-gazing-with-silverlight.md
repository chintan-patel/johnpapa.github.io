<p>In the latest issue of my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd148648.aspx#">Data Points column in</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd148648.aspx"><img title="2008-11-MSDN" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="260" alt="2008-11-MSDN" width="203" align="right" border="0" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/CloudGazingwithSilverlight_14AD8/2008-11-MSDN_3.gif" /></a> MSDN Magazine (Nov 2008 issue) I wrote an article titled &ldquo;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd148648.aspx#">Cloud Gazing From Silverlight 2</a>&rdquo;. It answers some of the most common questions I get when I start talking about Silverlight 2 programs being used for data centric and service driven apps. In the article I address:</p>
<p>- How to handle web services from Silverlight 2</p>
<p>- Consuming ASMX web services</p>
<p>- Consuming WCF SOAP services</p>
<p>- Consuming RESTful services</p>
<p>- LINQ to XML and its role in Silverlight 2</p>
<p>- Cross domain policies</p>
<p>Obviously there is a lot more to talk about in the web service storyline for Silverlight 2, but that&rsquo;s yet another reason I wrote an entire book on the topic. This article covers the basic needed to jumpstart Silverlight development with web services. Enjoy!</p>
