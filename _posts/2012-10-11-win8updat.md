Dan Wahlin and I have <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/win8-intro">updated our Introduction to WindowsÂ 8 Applications course with Pluralsight</a>. The updates include 2 entirely new modules on building both HTML/JS apps and XAML apps with Visual Studio 2012.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/win8-intro"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8071" title="10-11-2012 5-54-58 PM" src="http://images.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/10-11-2012-5-54-58-PM.png" alt="" width="500" height="85" /></a></p>
You can check out the course material on the site, and the quick list of topics is below. My favorite new clip is some candy on an introduction to using MVVM with Windows 8 XAML apps in the last module.

Dan and I hope you enjoy it!
