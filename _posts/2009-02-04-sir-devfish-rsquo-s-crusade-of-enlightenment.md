Yet even in the darkest of times, when the shadow looms over us all, sometimes a glimmer of hope peers through the clouds. <a href="http://www.devfish.net/">Sir DevFish, Joe Healy</a>, is riding once again this winter to bring enlightenment to all who will listen as he brings the <a href="http://www.devfish.net/fullblogitemview.aspx?blogid=623">MSDN Roadshow Tiki Hut Tour to the people</a>. He will bring with him news of the great jQuery, the savior of client side scripting. He will bring with him news of Data Services, the vast knowledge of data from libraries long lost. And he will bring with him sight into the future of the cloud, with Azure. Join Sir DevFish and his trusty companion Squire Jeff Barnes as they journey through the land of the sunshine on their crusade. </p>  <p> Join Sir DevFish on his quest … come to the MSDN Tiki Hut Road Show …</p>  <p>&#160;<strong><a href="http://www.devfish.net/fullblogitemview.aspx?blogid=623">MSDN Tiki Hut Roadshow</a>       <br /></strong></p>  <p><b>Session 1 – jQuery with ASP.NET</b> - JQuery is an open source JavaScript library that has a passionate following among Ajax developers. Microsoft is integrating the open source JQuery library into both the ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC frameworks and providing full product support. Learn how you can take advantage of JQuery to build richly interactive client-side Ajax applications when developing either ASP.NET Web Forms or ASP.NET MVC applications. Also see how JQuery works in combination with ASP.NET AJAX to provide the best framework for building Ajax applications.</p>  <p><b>Session 2 – Data Services</b> - OnPremise and Off - In the near future, applications will be developed using a combination of custom application code and online building block services, including data-centric services. In this session we discuss advancements in the Microsoft development platform and online service interfaces to enable seamless interaction with data services both on-premises (e.g., ADO.NET Data Services Framework over on-premises SQL Server) and in the cloud (e.g., SQL Server Data Services). Learn how you can leverage existing know-how related to LINQ (Language Integrated Query), data access APIs, data-binding, and more when building applications using online data.</p>  <p><b>Session 3 – Architecting for the Cloud using Windows Azure</b> - This session provides a tour of the Windows Azure cloud computing platform, an overview of its various components, and explains how these fit together to provide best-of-cloud experiences. We will explore the architecture that links many of the Microsoft .NET services and lets ISVs and businesses deliver compelling solutions. Learn how to compose these services with SQL Data Services to create applications in the cloud and connect them with on-premise systems. We will also examine the next generation of messaging, data, access control, and directory services, and how they fit together to provide a seamless integration into the cloud.</p>
